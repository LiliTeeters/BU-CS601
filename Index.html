        <p>Hello there! My name is Lili and I live in Salt Lake City, UT. Before being accepted into the BU MSSD program I was a Recreation Therapist. I was an RT for almost 6 years and before that I was a medic in the Army. It seems weird to do such a drastic change but in all honesty, burnout is a very real thing that happens in the medical field. In other words, I have very little experience (CS300 and CS 521) but I am so excited to be here as I believe that this change is very fitting for me. I have really enjoyed my previous classes and the instructors/facilitators have been very helpful and patient. Thank you!. </p>
